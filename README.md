# 🛒 E-Commerce Web Application

🚀This project is the first web e-commerce application I've developed using Django and Python. I aimed to create a basic e-commerce system. Users can view products, add them to carts, and create orders. I developed this project for learning purposes and plan to add new features in the future. The project is currently running locally but has not yet been released online. However, the core functionality is complete and is planned for release with future development.

- ✅ Payment integration (sample payment)
